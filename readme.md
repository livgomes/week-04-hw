# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## WEEK-04- More on HTML
### 1. SUMMARY

Week 4 of MART-341 went into greater depth of HTML, learning the various ways to add links to HTML. Additionally we learnt new semantic markup codes and finally we learnt how to open and view the code behind other webpages.

**List in HTML**

-1. Ordered list- list that follow a specific sequence, such as A-Z, 1-10 etc.
-2. Unordered list- information stated through point format, no specific sequence.
-3. Nested Lists- A combination of multiple list, of any type.
-4. Definition List- Listed used to define different terms or words, can be connected through hyperlink.

**Semantic Markup**

-Semantic Markup language are the elements of text that create a form of emphasis to the specific word, phrase or sentence.
Some examples include;

1. Bold and Strong `(<b>...</b>) & (<strong>..</strong>)`
2. Italics and Emphasis `<i>...</i> & <em>...</em>`
3. Superscript and Subscript `(sup>...</sup>) & (<sub>...</sub>)`
4. Citations `(<cite>...</cite>)`

**Linking**

A hyperlink is a direct link to another source, this could be a direct source to another area of the same webpage, a link to another webpage, a link to an email address etc.
