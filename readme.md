# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## WEEK-04- More on HTML
### 1. SUMMARY

Week 4 of MART-341 went into greater depth of HTML, learning the various ways to add links to HTML. Additionally we learnt new semantic markup codes and finally we learnt how to open and view the code behind other webpages.

**List in HTML**

-1. Ordered list- list that follow a specific sequence, such as A-Z, 1-10 etc.
-2. Unordered list- information stated through point format, no specific sequence.
-3. Nested Lists- A combination of multiple list, of any type.
-4. Definition List- Listed used to define different terms or words, can be connected through hyperlink.

**Semantic Markup**

-Semantic Markup language are the elements of text that create a form of emphasis to the specific word, phrase or sentence.
Some examples include;

1. Bold and Strong `(<b>...</b>) & (<strong>..</strong>)`
2. Italics and Emphasis `<i>...</i> & <em>...</em>`
3. Superscript and Subscript `(sup>...</sup>) & (<sub>...</sub>)`
4. Citations `(<cite>...</cite>)`

**Linking**

A hyperlink is a direct link to another source, this could be a direct source to another area of the same webpage, a link to another webpage, a link to an email address etc.

**Inspecting Code**

This week we learnt how to inspect the code of different HTML webpages. Using my chrome browser, I was able to view the codes used when creating the HTML webpage. This was access by simply right clicking on the web page and selecting `inspect`. I found this extremly interesting to see and extremly helping for this weeks assignment, as it helped me greatly solve problems I was having, when trying to attach different links to my webpage.


## Wayback Machine

**Time magazine

This week we used the wayback machine to serach the archives of a webpage, at which i chose time magazine. While looking at time magazine, I jumped from the present 2017 to 2006 and finally 1999. This was such a fun exercise, as the change in the webpage over time was quite noticable and interesting to view.
The time magazine in 2017 has a more advanced look to the webpage, with more and larger pictures. It has a cleaner look with the headline story posted at the centre, recently posted links with imagines and breif descriptions in a neat coloumn to the left . Additional links as tabs allowing viewers to sign in or subscribe and a Time dropdown coloumn for further search engines.

The is a visual change in the time magazine webpage from 2006, there is alot more int=formation crammed on the front page, the Time dropdown column does not exsist in 2006, instead all additional links are visable in the side column to the left. This layout is very dated and creates a sense of confusion to the visual eye.

The image below is of the time magazine webpage from 1999, the year the site was made live.There is a visual change in the site yet again, the sign and subscribe tabs are not present here. The hyperlinks in the side left coloumn are not catergorzied and give very little information. All in all it is a very basic version of the current site, providing less visual imformation. A notable similarity between all three images however is the basic layout of information remained the same oveer the years. The main story at the front and centre of the page and all other imformation and links, placed in the left hand column for further search.

**Slikati over the years

The contempory artist I chose was Sliikati, who is a Missoula photographer. When comparing his webpage which began in 2011, there was yet again a visual change. The graphics between 2011 and 2017 changed widley. In the present webpage, Slikati has revolving large images of their work. It has a modern clean look to it, that displays very little information on the homepage. The main forcus of the home page displays their work, In order to learn more you must click another link.
This is different to the 2011 version, as although a large image is seen, the viewer is distracted by the outdated framed graphic. There is also alot more visual blank/wasted space in the 2011 version and most notably all the main links are displayed on the home page.
